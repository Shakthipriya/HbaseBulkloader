h1. Hbase Bulkloader

Very simple bulk loader for hbase.


h2. Caveats

@HADOOP_CLASSPATH@ needs to be defined in @/etc/hadoop/conf/hadoop-env.sh@ properly. That is:

<pre><code>
export HADOOP_CLASSPATH=<stuff>:$HADOOP_CLASSPATH
</code></pre>

Note the last bit. This allows us to set extra hadoop classpath entries, say, on the command line.

h2. Usage

Dumb simple at the moment: you have data that is exactly 4 TAB separated fields (row key, column family, qualifier, value).

Assuming you write into a table called "foobar" then:

<pre><code>
bin/load --table_name=foobar /path/to/input_data
</code></pre>

will launch a hadoop job to load data on the map side. No reduces.
